# ADR-0001: Dependency-First Policy

## Status
Accepted

## Decision
AxiomWeb must evaluate and prefer dependencies from Apple/Swift.org/SSWG/Swift Server Community collections before implementing custom infrastructure.

## Consequences
- Reduces maintenance burden.
- Aligns with ecosystem standards.
- Requires ADR rationale when custom replacement is chosen.
